# Personal Toolbox images

I've switched my Laptop to Fedora Silverblue so I needed some images for Toolbox in order to have my
development environments ready. I've decided to make my own since I already have some preferences
regarding the base I'm upon which I'll build other images.

In the [images](./images/) directory, you can find the Dockerfiles for all images I made. They are very
opinionated and I don't plan on accepting any feature requests. You are however free to use those
Dockerfiles freely and build upon them to make your own.
