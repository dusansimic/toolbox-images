# Base image

This image is meant as a base image for all other images I make. It contains tools I would usually need in every development environment. It very opinionated so do not send feature requests for it. All other images are meant to be as indenpendent as possible from this image so you could use them even without this base.

List of extra packages can be found in the file [extra-packages](./extra-packages).
